Planning Process:
1) Identify and understand the issues. I wanted to fully understand the requirements of the game so inform my road map.
2) Come up with user stories to better understand the flow of code and whether all requirements are met.
3) Draw wireframes to guide layout of game.
4) Set up basic HTML file to get an idea of whether code was working as expected.
5) Write Javascript and CSS to feed HTML file.
6) Set up shell and API scripts
7) Finish cosmetics of game

Approach to Problem Solving:
1) Identify end game.
2) Break issue into smaller pieces and log result.
3) Identify where issue may be (typically is scope issue).
4) Google potential issue... use MDN and stackoverflow mostly

Unsolved Problems Hope to Be Fixed:
1) Additional stats from user games
2) Streamlined functions


4-8 user stories for your game project.
1) As a user, I can choose what spots should be X's while the computer choose O's
2) As a user, I can choose whether I am X's or O's
3) As a user, I can log in and log out
4) As a user, the program will remember my record against the computer
